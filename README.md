# SQLite-PHP-Database

A **simple** example of a website with a backend using SQLite and PHP that you can host **anywhere** without any **additional setup**.

The example website is a basic student attendance system with essential features like adding and searching attendance records. There are two pages: one for submitting attendance and one for viewing the attendance data based on the student's roll number.

## Getting Started

**Download this repository and extract the zip file.** â¬‡

**Upload all the files to your website hosting server.** ðŸš€

## Files

1. **create_database.php**: Run this script once to create the SQLite database and table ( database schema ).
2. **index.html**: HTML form for submitting attendance.
3. **add_record.php**: PHP script to save attendance data to the SQLite database.
4. **search_record.html**: HTML form to input a roll number to view attendance data.
5. **search_record.php**: PHP script to retrieve and display attendance data based on the roll number.
6. **.htaccess**: Configuration file to restrict access to the database file.

You can host these files on a web server that supports PHP. Ensure the server has write permissions to create and modify the `students.db` SQLite file.

## Usage


### Step 1: Create the Database

Run `create_database.php` once to create the SQLite database and table. You can do this by navigating to `create_database.php` in your browser: <br/>
`http://yourdomain.com/create_database.php`

### Step 2: Submit Attendance

Navigate to `index.html` in your browser and use the form to submit attendance:<br/> `http://yourdomain.com/index.html`


## Notes

- Ensure your web server has write permissions to create and modify the `students.db` SQLite file.
- The database file `students.db` will be created in the directory specified in the PHP scripts.
- Implement security measures like restricting access to the database file using `.htaccess` for Apache or appropriate configurations for other web servers.
- Set correct file permissions for the SQLite database file (e.g., `chmod 600` on Unix-based systems).


## Summary

- **SQLite**: A file-based database system.
- **Database File**: `students.db` stores the entire database.
- **PHP Scripts**: Use PHP Data Objects (PDO) to interact with the SQLite database.
  - **create_database.php**: Sets up the database and table.
  - **submit_attendance.php**: Inserts data into the database.
  - **view_attendance.php**: Retrieves data from the database.

This simple setup makes SQLite an excellent choice for small to medium-sized applications, especially where ease of setup and use is important.
